# DSA-with-CPP
Welcome to the **DSA with C++** repository! 🛠️
DSA repository in C++ aligned with the CodeHelp playlist. Covers arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting, and dynamic programming with optimized solutions. Perfect for beginners looking to strengthen their DSA foundation.

## 📂 Repository Structure:
- **Arrays**: Basic problems, sliding window techniques, subarrays.
- **Strings**: Palindrome checks, string manipulations.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementation and algorithms for singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- **Stacks & Queues**: Problems and implementations.
- **Trees**: Traversals, Binary Search Trees (BST), etc.
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, and shortest path algorithms.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Knapsack, Fibonacci, and more.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, quick sort, merge sort, etc.

## 🛠 How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-with-Cpp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder for the topic you’re working on:
   ```bash
   cd Trees/
   ```
3. Compile and run the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ binary_tree_traversal.cpp -o binary_tree
   ./binary_tree
   ```
