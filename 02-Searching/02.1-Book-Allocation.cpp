// Ayush is studying for NinjaTest, which will be held after 'N' days. 
// To score good marks, he has to study 'M' chapters, and the i-th chapter requires TIME[i] seconds to study. 
// The day in Ayushâ€™s world has 100^100 seconds. The rules for studying are:
// 1. He reads the chapters sequentially, i.e., he studies (i+1)-th chapter only after completing the i-th chapter.
// 2. If he starts a chapter on a particular day, he completes it on the same day.
// 3. Ayush wants to distribute his workload over 'N' days to minimize the maximum study time in a day.
//
// Task: Find the minimal value of the maximum amount of time Ayush studies in a single day to complete all chapters in no more than 'N' days.
//
// Constraints:
// 1 <= T <= 10
// 1 <= N, M <= 10^4
// 1 <= TIME[i] <= 10^9
